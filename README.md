names-array
===========
names = ['bob', 'joe', 'susan', 'margaret']
names ['margaret'] = 'jody'

# in this problem, we want jody to be margaret, but because the
#error came up, we have to find out how to fix it. instead of
# names ['margaret'] as stated above, we need to change margaret
# to a number instead. it is in placement 3 as arrays start at 0
# by doing that this will replace margaret with jody.
